V01	This approach was soon followed by other researchers (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004), focus21 ing on improved sets of features, improved machine learning methods or both, and SRL became a shared task at the CoNLL 2004, 2005 and 2008 conferences1. ::: D09-1003_23:203
M17,M02,P17	Traditionally, either constituent or dependency based, semantic role labeling is done in two steps, argument identification and classification (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: W11-0906_17:205

R01	To develop an automatic SRL system for the biomedical domain, it is necessary to train the system with an annotated corpus, called proposition bank (Palmer et al. , 2005). ::: W06-0602_23:182
A01,A02,A05	Others have applied frame-semantic structures to question answering, paraphrase/entailment recognition, and information extraction (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004; Shen and Lapata, 2007; Pado and Erk, 2005; Burchardt, 2006; Moschitti et al., 2003; Surdeanu et al., 2003). ::: N10-1138_212:219

M02	The partial trees output by these systems were merged with the parse trees returned by (Charniak, 2000)s parser. ::: W06-2303_139:147
F04,V01	This assumption is a simple adaptation of the pruning algorithm by Xue and Palmer (2004), and it holds for the vast majority of arguments in the CoNLL-2008 data; in the training set, we measured that this covers 99.04% of the arguments of verbs and 97.55% of the argu2Since our algorithm needs to know the positions of the predicates, we trained a separate classifier using the LIBLINEAR toolkit (Fan et al., 2008) to identify the predicate words. ::: D09-1059_98:170
	Conversely, researchers interested in producing richer semantic outputs have concentrated on two-stage systems, where the semantic labelling task is performed on the output of a parser, in a pipeline architecture divided in several stages (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Nielsen and Pradhan, 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: W05-1509_22:202

	We create a baseline system using a subset of features introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), which are directly applicable to nominal predicates. ::: N04-4036_2:121
	Our model considers two sets of features: Feature Set 1 (FS1): features used in the work reported in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) and (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) ; and Feature Set 2 (FS2): a novel set of features introduced in this paper. ::: P03-1002_77:187
O02	Shallow approaches to semantic processing are making large advances in the direction of efficiently and effectively deriving application relevant explicit semantic information from text (Pradhan et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Moschitti, 2004; Moschitti et al., 2005; Diab et al., 2008). ::: W10-1836_10:111
M17	It is well known that dependency trees extracted from lexicalized phrase structure parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) typically are more accurate than those produced by pure dependency parsers (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003). ::: P05-1012_174:209
A01	Researchers were able to construct a reasonable IE system by simply mapping specific Arg labels for a set of verbs to template slots, completely avoiding the necessity of building explicit regular expression pattern matchers (Surdeanu et al. 2003). ::: J05-1004_487:501
R02	It should be noted that our results of kernel combinations on FrameNet are in contrast with (Moschitti, 2004), where no improvement was obtained. ::: E06-1015_181:212
M02	Our evaluation criteria which is based on predicting the SRL for constituents in the parse tree is based on the evaluation used in (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: D07-1062_120:201
M05,M16	This is very valuable as previous work showed that tree kernels (TK) alone perform lower than models based on manually engineered features for SRL tasks, e.g., (Moschitti, 2004; Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004; Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006; Moschitti, 2006b; Che et al., 2006; Moschitti et al., 2008). ::: D11-1096_228:238
M02,F05	A more realistic way to score the performance is to score tags assigned to head words of constituents, rather than considering the exact boundaries of the constituents as reported by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003). ::: P05-1072_150:208
O02,M02,P06,P17	Argument filtering Previous work in shallow semantic parsing has demonstrated that not all nodes in a tree are equally probable as semantic roles for a given predicate (Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: P06-1146_110:209

R01,D01,M02	The task of semantic role labeling in the context of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is to label tree nodes with semantic roles in a syntactic parse tree. ::: D09-1047_45:202
M13	We formulate the labeling task as a classification problem as initiated by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers (2005). ::: N07-1070_40:232
	(Pradhan et al. , 2004) train a language model over label sequences. ::: P05-1073_179:185
P17	Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) first tackled SRL as an independent task, which is divided into several sub-tasks such as argument identification, argument classification, global inference, etc. Some researchers (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Koomen et al., 2005; Cohn and Blunsom, 2005; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2005; Toutanova et al., 2008) used a pipelined approach to attack the task. ::: C10-2083_8:87
M16	In addition, Moschitti (2004)s Tree Kernel Tool is used to compute the tree kernel function. ::: P06-2010_146:184
	We also compared our proposed feature set against predicate/argument features (PAF) proposed by (Moschitti, 2004). ::: D07-1062_149:201
M13	To put our results in the context of previous work, other results on core arguments using the same input features have been reported, the best being 91.4% for an SVM with a degree 2 polynomial kernel (Pradhan et al. , 2005a).3 The highest reported result for independent classification of core arguments is 96.0% for a log-linear model using more than 20 additional basic features (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: W06-1668_202:239
M02	Note that this pruning algorithm is slightly different from that of (Xue and Palmer, 2004), the predicate itself is also included in the argument candidate list as the nominal predicate sometimes takes itself as its argument. ::: D09-1004_53:221
R01,R09	The data consist of sections of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. , 1993), with information on predicate-argument structures extracted from the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al. , 2005). ::: P06-2010_123:184
R01	Again, we concentrate on the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al. , 2005), which is the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn TreeBank corpus enriched with predicate argument structures. ::: W05-0620_22:334
M02	Things become worse still in a parser like the one described in Charniak (2000) because it conditions on (and hence splits the dynamic programming states according to) features of the grandparent node in addition to the parent, thus multiplying the number of possible dynamic programming states even more. ::: P05-1022_56:180
	(Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) used the empirical probability of the set of proposed arguments as a prior distribution. ::: P05-1073_178:185

M19	Whole Label Sequence: As observed in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004), including information about the set or sequence of labels assigned to argument nodes should be very helpful for disambiguation. ::: P05-1073_106:185
	The features incorporated in the proposed model are inspired from the work of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2005; Collins, 1999) and can be classified into five classes: (a) features that capture the internal structure of the candidate argument, (b) features extracted The syntactic label of the candidate constituent. ::: W05-0635_22:78
O02	The motivation behind is that structured syntactic information plays a critical role in negation scope finding and should be paid much more attention, as indicated by previous studies in shallow semantic parsing (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2005). ::: C10-1076_31:201
	(Xue and Palmer, 2004) or (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005). ::: W06-2607_15:203
	Instead, we borrowed most of them from the existing literature (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras et al. , 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: W05-0628_33:100
E01	While all these systems perform quite well on the WSJ test data, they show significant performance degradation (approximately 10 point drop in F-score) when applied to label test data that is different than the genre that WSJ represents (Pradhan et al. , 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005). ::: N07-1070_18:232
M07	Although state-of-the-art SRL systems use sophisticated statistical models to perform these two tasks jointly (e.g. Toutanova et al., 2005, Johansson and Nugues, 2008), we implemented them as two independent support vector classifiers to be able to analyze the impact of syntactic representation on each task separately. ::: C08-1050_64:214
	The term is most commonly used to describe the automatic identification and labeling of the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: D11-1122_8:233
	The best phrase-structure parsing models represent generatively the joint probability P(x,y) of sentence x having the structure y (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000). ::: P05-1012_5:209
R02,R05	In English predicate argument structure analysis, large corpora such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2001), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) have been created and utilized. ::: D08-1055_7:129
R01	One such augmented parser, trained on data available from the PropBank project has been recently presented in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002). ::: P03-1002_24:187
	The systems for the other languages follow the successful models devised for English, (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; 95 Xue and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al. , 2003). ::: W07-2017_109:201
	For example, the SRL system described in (Pradhan et al. , 2005b; Pradhan et al. , 2005a) achieves an Fscore of 81% when tested on the same genre as it is trained on (WSJ); but that score drops to 68.5% when the same system is tested on a different genre (the Brown corpus). ::: N07-1069_37:158
	Moschitti (2004) only selected the relative portion between a predicate and an argument. ::: P06-2010_68:184
F07,M02	Features extracted from LTAG derivations are different and provide distinct information when compared to predicate-argument features (PAF) or subcategorization features (SCF) used in (Moschitti, 2004) or even the later use of argument spanning trees (AST) in the same framework. ::: D07-1062_193:201
	Of special interest here, Moschitti (2004) proposed Predicate Argument Feature (PAF) kernel for SRL under the framework of convolution tree kernel. ::: P07-1026_50:194
	Here, solid lines correspond to surface syntactic structure, produced by Charniaks parser (Charniak, 2000), and dashed lines are an encoding of the Proposition Bank annotation of the semantic roles with respect to the verb stopped. ::: W07-0208_26:151
	We adopt the same algorithm described in (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: W06-2909_100:206
F05	Content words, which add informative lexicalized information different from the head word, were detected using the heuristics of (Surdeanu et al. , 2003). ::: H05-1081_92:230
D01	It is generally formulated as a semantic role labeling (SRL) task, where each argument of the predicate is assigned a label that represents the semantic role it plays with regard to its predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Hacioglu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004b; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Toutanova et al. , 2005; Koomen et al. , 2005). ::: N06-1055_9:170
M02	First, argument candidates are generated from the input constituent parse tree using the prevalent heuristic-based pruning algorithm in (Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: C10-2076_103:199
	Most approaches to the problem of SRL follow the Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) model. ::: P09-1048_41:262
R01	PropBank encodes propositional information by adding a layer of argument structure annotation to the syntactic structures of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993). ::: N06-2026_32:89
P01,P02	Though PropBank defines semantic roles on a verb by verb basis, for a particular verb, Arg0 is generally the argument exhibiting features of a prototypical Agent while Arg1 is a prototypical Patient or Theme (Palmer et al., 2005). ::: P09-2064_35:110
	Propbank (Palmer et al, 2005) is a hand-annotated corpus. ::: P10-3014_15:146
F07,M07,R01	Approaches include incorporating a subcategorization feature (Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002; Xue & Palmer, 2004), such as the one used in our baseline; and building a model which jointly classifie,s all arguments of a verb (Toutanova et al., 2005). ::: P08-1040_201:218
V01	For the test data, we report on results using the gold-standard Tree bank data,and in addition we also report results on automatically parsed data using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) as provided by the CoNLL 2005 shared task. ::: D07-1062_47:201
M02	State-of-the-art models for the subproblem of classification of core arguments additionally use other features of individual nodes (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al. , 2005a), as well as global features including the labels of other nodes in parse tree. ::: W06-1668_152:239
M02	It happens that, in the case of full parses, this node selection strategy is equivalent to the pruning process defined by Xue and Palmer (2004), which selects sibling nodes along the path of ancestors from the verb predicate to the root of the tree2. ::: W05-0628_20:100
	Their corpora are used to train supervised models for semantic role labelling (SRL) of new text (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005). ::: C08-1084_9:229
M13	The evaluations were carried out with the SVMLight-TK2 software (Moschitti, 2004) which extends the SVM-Light package (Joachims, 1999) with tree kernel functions. ::: W07-2062_37:67
	SRL approach The SRL approach that we adopt is based on the deep syntactic parse (Charniak, 2000) of the sentence that we intend to annotate semantically. ::: W06-2607_37:203
F03,F04,F05	Top-10 combined features for SRI and SRC ranked by z-score Table 1 shows that the commonly used combined features, such as 'predicate+head word' (c1+c6) and 'position+voice' (c4+c5) proposed by (Xue and Palmer, 2004) are also included. ::: C10-2076_120:199
M20	There is a growing body of work on statistical learning for different versions of the semantic parsing problem (e.g., (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Mooney, 2007)), however, most of these methods rely on human annotation, or some weaker forms of supervision (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Liang et al., 2009; Titov and Kozhevnikov, 2010; Clarke et al., 2010) and very little research has considered the unsupervised setting. ::: P11-1145_199:216
	Our experiments working with a flat, chunked representation of the input sentence, described in more detail in Gildea and Palmer (2002), test this finite-state hypothesis. ::: J05-1004_438:501

	Arguments to Syntactic Constituents Our approach maps each argument label to one syntactic constituent, using a strategy similar to (Surdeanu et al. , 2003). ::: W05-0635_10:78

F01,F02,F03,F04,F05,F07	Among them, we select the following subset: (a) Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word, 134 Position and Voice as defined in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002); (b) Partial Path, No Direction Path, Head Word POS, First and Last Word/POS in Constituent and SubCategorization as proposed in (Pradhan et al. , 2003); and (c) Syntactic Frame as designed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: W07-2026_47:93
	The training set is extracted from TreeBank (Marcus et al. , 1993) section 1518, the development set, used in tuning parameters of the system, from section 20, and the test set from section 21. ::: C04-1197_181:216

R01	For our experiments, we use Feb 2004 release of PropBank1 (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Palmer et al. , 2005), a corpus in which predicate argument relations are marked for verbs in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. , 1994). ::: P05-1072_23:208
P06	In order to speed up the learning process, we use a four-stage learning architecture: Stage 1: To save time, we use a pruning stage (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out the constituents that are clearly not semantic arguments to the predicate. ::: P06-2010_135:184
	Note that the result here is not comparable with the best in this domain (Pradhan et al. , 2004) where the full parse tree is assumed given. ::: C04-1197_204:216
	Neighboring arguments The research of (Jiang et al. , 2005; Toutanova et al. , 2005) has shown the importance of capturing information of the global argument frame in order to correctly classify the local argument. ::: W06-1617_96:156
	Whereas many more global constraints were taken into account in (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Koomen et al., 2005). ::: C10-1153_132:255
	And previous research on English SRL shows that combination is a robust and effective method to alleviate SRLs dependency on parsing results (M`arquez et al., 2005; Koomen et al., 2005; Pradhan et al., 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2007; Toutanova et al., 2008). ::: C10-1153_13:255
	Methods used include bootstrapping approaches (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Kate and Mooney, 2007), where large unannotated corpora were tagged with SRL annotation, later to be used to retrain the SRL model. ::: P09-1004_78:272
F02	About 10% of the fragments contain both the predicate and the argument node, while about 1% encode the Path feature traditionally used in explicit semantic role labeling models (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: W09-1106_192:202
M11	For example, the backoff lattice in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) consists of eight connected nodes for a five-feature set. ::: P03-1002_64:187
M11	The statistical model introduced in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) uses predicate lexical information at most levels in the probability lattice, hence its scalability to unknown predicates is limited. ::: P03-1002_136:187
	Our standard feature set is a combination of features proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), (Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Pradhan et al. , 2005b) and (Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: D07-1062_98:201
	More details of this system can be found in Pradhan et al. , (2005). ::: N07-1070_43:232
M10	Local classifiers Following the standard practice in semantic role labeling, we divided the case prediction task into the tasks of identification and classification (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004). ::: P06-1132_86:211
M02	These systems all use (Charniak, 2000)s parse trees both for training and testing, as well as various other information sources including sets of n-best parse trees, chunks, or named entities. ::: N06-2026_72:89
M02	In this paper, we apply the traditional boundary (TBC) and role (TRC) classifiers (Pradhan et al. , 2005a), which are based on binary predicate/argument relations, to label all parse tree nodes corresponding to potential arguments. ::: W06-2909_18:206
	This greedy combination method is very simple and has been adopted in previous research (Pradhan et al., 2005; M`arquez et al., 2005). ::: C10-1153_108:255
	Next, sentences are analyzed by a state-of-the-art syntactic parser (Charniak, 2000) the output of which provides useful information for the main SRL module. ::: H05-2004_21:45
	Hence, the process is divided into framing and annotation (Palmer et al., 2005). ::: W10-1836_63:111
	Semantic Role labeling (SRL) was first defined in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). ::: D08-1034_12:270

	In recent years, corpora annotated with semantic and function labels have seen the light (Palmer et al. , 2005; Baker et al. , 1998) and semantic role labelling has taken centre-stage as a challenging new task. ::: W05-1509_8:202
	We tested several kernels over standard features (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005) and structured features (Moschitti et al., 2008): the Polynomial Kernel (PK, with a degree of 3), the Tree Kernel (TK) and its combination with the bag of word kernel on the tree leaves (TKL). ::: N09-2022_42:90
M07	This is from a general belief that each step requires a different set of features (Xue and Palmer, 2004), and training these steps in a pipeline takes less time than training them as a joint-inference task. ::: W11-0906_18:205

R02,R04	Most approaches rely on VerbNet (Kipper et al. , 2000) and FrameNet (Baker et al. , 1998) to provide associations between verbs and semantic roles, that are then mapped onto the current instance, as shown by the systems competing in semantic role labelling competitions (Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005) and also (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2005; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005). ::: W06-3813_43:195

	For this task we utilized the August 2005 release of the Charniak parser with the default speed/accuracy settings (Charniak, 2000), which required roughly 360 hours of processor time on a 2.5 GHz PowerPC G5. ::: P07-1025_85:217
	Most of the features we designed are features that have become standard for the SRL task (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005). ::: W07-2038_48:108
	Unlike (Poon and Domingos, 2009), we do not use the lambda calculus formalism to define our task but rather treat it as an instance of frame-semantic parsing, or a specific type of semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: P11-1145_42:216

	With the efforts of many researchers (Carreras and Mrquez 2004, 2005, Moschitti 2004, Pradhan et al 2005, Zhang et al 2007), different machine learning methods and linguistics resources are applied in this task, which has made SRL task progress fast. ::: D08-1034_16:270

F02,M02	Additionally, the dashed lines show those edges which were pruned, following Xue and Palmer (2004) only nodes which are siblings to a node on the path from the verb to the root are included in the tree. ::: W05-0622_24:69
R01	A crucial difference from similar approaches, such as SRL with PropBank roles (Pradhan et al. , 2004) is that by identifying relations as part of a frame, you have identi ed a gestalt of relations that enables far more inference, and sentences from the same passage that use other words from the same frame will be easier to link together. ::: W07-2018_96:162

*F01,F02,F03,F04,F05,F06,F07,M02	Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) presented a compact set of features across these three types, which has served as the core of most of the subsequent SRL work: (1) the phrase type, headword, and governing category of the constituent; (2) the lemma, voice, and subcategorization pattern of the verb; and (3) the left/right position of the constituent with respect to the verb, and the category path between them.Extensions to these features have been proposed in various directions.Exploiting the ability of some machine learning algorithms to work with very large feature spaces, some authors have largely extended the representation of the constituent and its context, including among others: rst and last words (and part-of-speech) in the constituent, bag-of-words, n-grams of part of speech, and sequence of top syntactic elements in the constituent.Parent and sibling constituents in the tree may also be codied with all the previous structural and lexical features (Pradhan et al.2005a; Surdeanu et al.2007).Other authors have designed new features with specic linguistic motivations.For instance, Surdeanu et al.(2003) generalized the concept of headword with the content word feature.They also used named entity labels as features.Xue and Palmer (2004) presented the syntactic frame feature, which captures the overall sentence structure using the verb predicate and the constituent as pivots.All these features resulted in a signicant increase in performance. ::: J08-2001_53:86

	To avoid this problem, generative models for NLP tasks have often been manually designed to achieve an appropriate representation of the joint distribution, such as in the parsing models of (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000). ::: W06-1668_14:239

	On the other hand, probabilistic inference processes, which have been successfully used for SRL (Koomen et al. , 2005), mandate that each individual candidate argument be associated with its raw activation, or confidence, in the given model. ::: H05-1081_22:230
R02	With the advent of faster and powerful computers, more effective machine learning algorithms, and importantly, large data resources annotated with relevant levels of semantic information FrameNet (Baker et al. , 1998) and Prob Bank corpora (Palmer et al. , 2005), we are seeing a surge in efficient approaches to SRL (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005). ::: W07-2017_105:201

M02	Recent successes in statistical syntactic parsing based on supervised learning techniques trained on a large corpus of syntactic trees (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Henderson, 2003) have brought forth the hope that the same approaches could be applied to the more ambitious goal of recovering the propositional content and the frame semantics of a sentence. ::: W06-2303_3:147
	The term is most commonly used to describe the automatic identification and labeling of the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: P11-1112_8:246
	In a recent paper on the SRL on verbal predicates for English, (Toutanova et al. , 2005) pointed out that one potential flaw in a SRL system where each argument is considered on its own is that it does not take advantage of the fact that the arguments (not the adjuncts) of a predicate are subject to the hard constraint that they do not have the same label3. ::: N06-1055_139:170
	Not only did they achieve new performance benchmarks on parsing the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), and not only did they serve as the basis of Collins own future work (Collins 2000; Collins and Duffy 2002), but they also served as the basis of important work on parser selection (Henderson and Brill 1999), an investigation of corpus variation and the effectiveness of bilexical dependencies (Gildea 2001), sample selection (Hwa 2001), bootstrapping non-English parsers (Hwa, Resnik, and Weinberg 2002), and the automatic labeling of semantic roles and predicate-argument extraction (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000; Gildea and Palmer 2002), as well as that of other research efforts. ::: J04-4004_8:602
	Following the seminal work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), there have been many extensions in machine learning models, feature engineering (Xue and Palmer, 2004), and inference procedures (Toutanova et al., 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2007; Punyakanok et al., 2008). ::: D08-1008_15:220
	Most current semantic role labeling (SRL) approaches can be classified in one of two classes: approaches that take advantage of complete syntactic analysis of text, pioneered by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and approaches that use partial syntactic analysis, championed by the previous CoNLL shared task evaluations (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004). ::: W05-0635_5:78
M02	These systems use (Charniak, 2000)s parse trees both for training and testing as well as various other information sources including sets of n-best parse trees (Punyakanok et al. , 2005; Haghighi et al. , 2005) or chunks (Marquez et al. , 2005; Pradhan et al. , 2005) and named entities (Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005). ::: W06-2303_140:147

	SPs in a SRL system For these experiments we modified SwiRL (Surdeanu et al., 2007): (a) we matched the gold boundaries against syntactic constituents predicted internally using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000); and (b) we classified these constituents with their semantic role using a modified version of SwiRLs feature set. ::: N10-1058_71:103

R02	On the other hand, despite the relevant work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), it is still an open issue whether FrameNet classes and frame elements can be obtained and used automatically because of the richness of the semantic structures employed (Dzikovska et al. , 2004). ::: W07-1513_27:179

R01	To some extent, function labels overlap with semantic role labels as defined in PropBank (Palmer et al. , 2005). ::: W05-1509_16:202
	In recent years tree kernels have been shown to be interesting approaches for the modeling of syntactic information in natural language tasks, e.g. syntactic parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko et al. , 2003), Named Entity recognition (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and Semantic Parsing (Moschitti, 2004). ::: E06-1015_5:212
M09,M17	In recent years, many advances have been made on SRL using singular syntactic view, such as constituent (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2007), dependency (Hacioglu, 2004; Johansson and Nugues, 2008; Zhao et al., 2009), and CCG (Chen and Rambow, 2003; Boxwell et al, 2009). ::: C10-2076_23:199
	Initially, 7 features were proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and all following research has used these features and some additional ones. ::: W06-1668_149:239
V01	Several systems have incorporated such dependencies, for example, (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Thompson et al. , 2003) and several systems submitted in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004). ::: P05-1073_11:185

	The rationale for using a simple DL learner is given in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) where essentially it based on their experience with the setting of backoff weights for smoothing, it is stated that the most specific single feature matching the training data is enough to predict the SRL on test data. ::: W06-1518_53:103
	Because predicate lexical information is used for less than 5% of the branching decisions, the generated classifier scales better than the statistical method from (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) to unknown predicates. ::: P03-1002_185:187
	Though several pruning algorithms have been raised (Xue and Palmer, 2004), the policies are all in global style. ::: C08-1105_17:211
F05	Due to the sparsity of the head word feature, we also use the part-of-speech of the head word, following Surdeanu et al (2003). ::: N04-1032_123:287
	Looking at the description of the different systems, it becomes clear that the general type of features used in this edition is strongly based on previous work on the SRL task (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2005a; Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: W05-0620_231:334
M02	Regarding the design of features for predicate argument pairs, we can use the attribute-values defined in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002) or tree structures (Moschitti, 2004). ::: W06-2909_39:206
M09	We also compare with the CCG-based SRL presented in (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003)7, which has a similar motivation as this paper, except they use the Combinatory Categorial Grammar formalism and the CCGBank syntactic Treebank which was converted from the Penn Treebank. ::: W09-2601_144:186
F02,M09,M17	In order to generalize the path feature (see Table 1 in Section 3) which is probably the most salient (while being the most data sparse) feature for SRL, previous work has extracted features from other syntactic representations, such as CCG derivations (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) and dependency trees (Hacioglu, 2004) or integrated features from different parsers (Pradhan et al. , 2005b). ::: D07-1062_19:201
	As previously observed (Pradhan et al. , 2004), including modifying arguments in sequence features is not helpful. ::: P05-1073_112:185
R02	Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) describe a statistical system trained on the data from the FrameNet project to automatically assign semantic roles. ::: J05-1004_360:501
	As a guideline for interpreting these results, with 8,167 observations, the threshold for statistical significance with p < .05 is a 1.0% absolute difference in performance (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002). ::: J05-1004_399:501
	Previous approaches to the SRL task have made use of a full syntactic parse of the sentence in order to define argument boundaries and to determine the role labels (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Surdeanu et al. , 2003). ::: C04-1197_9:216
M02	On the one hand, SSTs provide learning algorithms with richer information which may be critical to capture syntactic properties of parse trees as shown, for example, in (Zelenko et al. , 2003; Moschitti, 2004). ::: E06-1015_13:212
	For example, we found that the SCF tree kernel (Moschitti, 2004) improves the AX multi classifier AX AM CX RX # train. ::: W05-0630_86:91

F02,M02	Instead of extracting a typical standard path feature from the derived tree, (Chen and Rambow, 2003) uses the path within the elementary tree from the predicate to the constituent argument. ::: D07-1062_179:201
P06	In addition, our system exploits a heuristic modified from that introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out very unlikely constituents. ::: H05-2004_27:45

O02	In contrast with features from shallow parsing, previous work (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al. , 2005b) has shown the necessity of full syntactic parsing for SRL. ::: D07-1062_18:201
F02	While the Path feature has been identified to be very important for the argument identification task, it is one of the most sparse features and may be difficult to train or generalize (Pradhan et al. , 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: P05-1072_53:208
*P01,P10,R01	Given the variability in the sets of roles used across the computational resources, an important issue is the extent to which different role sets affect the SRL task, as well as subsequent use of the output in other NLP applications.Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) initiated this type of investigation by exploring whether their results were dependent on the set of semantic roles they used.To this end, they mapped the FrameNet frame elements into a set of abstract thematic roles (i.e., more general roles such as Agent, Theme, Location), and concluded that their system could use these thematic roles 149 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 without degradation.Similar questions must be investigated in the context of PropBank, where the framesets for the verbs may have signicant domain-specic meanings and arguments due to the dependence of the project on WSJ data.Given the uncertainty in the linguistic status of semantic role lists, and the lack of evidence about which types of roles would be most useful in various NLP tasks, an important ongoing focus of attention is the value of mapping between the role sets of the different resources (Swier and Stevenson 2005; Loper, Yi, and Palmer 2007; Yi, Loper, and Palmer 2007). ::: J08-2001_38:86

E01	The rst step in SRL typically consists of ltering (or pruning) the set of argument candidates for a given predicate.Because arguments may be a continuous or discontinuous sequence of words, any subsequence of words in the sentence is an argument candidate.Exhaustive exploration of this space of candidates is not feasible, because it is both very large and imbalanced (i.e., the vast majority of candidates are not actual arguments of the verb).The simple heuristic rules of Xue and Palmer (2004) are commonly used to perform ltering because they greatly reduce the set of candidate arguments, while maintaining a very high recall. ::: J08-2001_43:86

R02	The growing interest in learning deeper information is to a large extent supported and due to the recent development of semantically annotated databases such as FrameNet (Baker et al. , 1998) or the Proposition Bank (Palmer et al. , 2005), that can be used as training resources for a number of supervised learning paradigms. ::: W06-2303_7:147

F02,M02	Parse tree paths were used for semantic role labeling by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) as descriptive features of the syntactic relationship between predicates and their arguments in the parse tree of a sentence. ::: P07-1025_19:217
M02	A careful analysis of such features reveals that most of them are syntactic tree fragments of training sentences, thus a natural way to represent them is the adoption of tree kernels as described in (Moschitti, 2004). ::: W06-2607_16:203

P12	In this paper, we find that the use of deep linguistic representations to predict these semantic labels are more effective than the generally more surface-syntax representations previously employed (Gildea and Palmer (2002)). ::: W03-1006_9:259
	We have experimentally evaluated 30 features based on the previous work in semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004): Lexical features (5): predicate (verb), first phrase word, last phrase word and words immediately before and after the phrase. ::: W05-0637_25:82

M02	To avoid explicit feature engineering on trees, (Moschitti, 2004) used convolution kernels on selective portions of syntactic trees. ::: D07-1062_20:201
	These features are common to many SRL systems and are described in Xue and Palmer (2004). ::: W05-0622_51:69

	However, there is not much research on combined use of different syntactic views (Pradhan et al., 2005), on the feature level of SRL. ::: C10-2076_14:199
M01	Moreover, we modeled SRL as a re-ranking task in line with (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: W06-2909_23:206
	In addition, while the system described here is based on pipelined classification, recent research on semantic role labeling has shown that significant performance improvements can be gained by exploiting interdependencies between arguments (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: W07-2048_88:92
M02	Finally, we would like to experiment with more sophisticated kernels, the tree kernels described in (Moschitti, 2004), i.e. models that have shown a lot of promise for the English SRL process. ::: W07-2026_91:93
	They are a combination of features introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), ones proposed in Pradhan et al. ::: W05-0634_58:111

	As proposition banks are semantically annotated versions of a Penn-style treebank, they provide consistent semantic role labels across different syntactic realizations of the same verb (Palmer et al. , 2005). ::: W06-3308_30:196

R01,R02	In previous work using the PropBank corpus, (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) proposed a model predicting argument roles using the same statistical method as the one employed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) for predicting semantic roles based on the FrameNet corpus (Baker et al. , 1998). ::: P03-1002_47:187
M08	Note that the form of the ILP model in this paper is different from that in (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Koomen et al., 2005) in three aspects: (1) A special label class null, which means no label is assigned, was added to the label set in (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Koomen et al., 2005). ::: C10-1153_127:255
A01,A02,A03,A04	Indeed, the analysis produced by existing semantic role labelers has been shown to benefit a wide spectrum of applications ranging from information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003) and question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007), to machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009) and summarization (Melli et al., 2005). ::: P11-1112_19:246
	These results are comparable to the results from Gildea and Palmer (2002), but only roughly because of differences in corpora. ::: W03-1006_245:259

M02	Recent successes in statistical syntactic parsing based on supervised techniques trained on a large corpus of syntactic trees (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Henderson, 2003) have brought the hope that the same approach could be applied to the more ambitious goal of recovering the propositional content and the frame semantics of a sentence. ::: N06-2026_4:89

M02	Some of these systems use features based on syntactic constituents produced by a Charniak parser (Pradhan et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004) and others use only a flat syntactic representation produced by a syntactic chunker (Hacioglu et al. , 2003; Hacioglu and Ward, 2003; Hacioglu, 2004; Hacioglu et al. , 2004). ::: W05-0634_14:111

M02	Introduction Robust syntactic parsers, made possible by new statistical techniques (Ratnaparkhi 1997; Collins 1999, 2000; Bangalore and Joshi 1999; Charniak 2000) and by the availability of large, hand-annotated training corpora (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Abeille 2003), have had a major impact on the field of natural language processing in recent years. ::: J05-1004_7:501

*M12	An important consideration within this general SRL architecture is the combination of systems and input annotations.Most SRL systems include some kind of combination to increase robustness, gain coverage, and reduce effects of parse errors.One may combine: (1) the output of several independent SRL basic systems (Surdeanu et al.2007; Pradhan et al.2005b), or (2) several outputs from the same SRL system obtained by changing input annotations or other internal parameters (Koomen et al. 2005; Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning 2005).The combination can be as simple as selecting the best among the set of complete candidate solutions, but usually consists of combining fragments of alternative solutions to construct the nal output.Finally, the combination component may involve machine learning or not.The gain in performance from the combination step is consistently between two and three F 1 points.However, a combination approach increases system complexity and penalizes efciency. ::: J08-2001_50:86
M02	It has previously been shown that SRL systems need a syntactic structure as input (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2008). ::: C08-1050_14:214
	This follows the pruning heuristic of (Xue and Palmer, 2004) often used by SRL algorithms. ::: P10-1024_148:365
R01,V01	In the recent years, most works on SRL, including two CoNLL shared task in 2004 and 2005, focus on verbal predicates with the availability of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). ::: D09-1004_16:221
	A wide range of features have been shown to be useful in previous work on semantic role labeling for verbal predicates (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004b; Xue and Palmer, 2004) and our experiments show most of them are also effective for SRL of nominalized predicates. ::: N06-1055_73:170
	Perhaps the closest work to that of ours is that of (Pradhan et al. , 2004a), where they reported preliminary work for analyzing the predicate-argument structure of Chinese nominalizations, using a small data set of 630 proposition for 22 nominalizations taken from the Chinese Treebank. ::: N06-1055_153:170

*F01,P10,R02	FrameNet thus consists of both a computational lexicon and a role-annotated corpus.The existence of such a corpus enabled Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) to develop the rst statistical machine learning approach to SRL, using various lexical and syntactic features such as phrase type and grammatical function calculated over the annotated constituents.Although this research spurred the current wave of SRL work that has 148 M`arquez, Carreras, Litkowski, and Stevenson Semantic Role Labeling rened and extended Gildea and Jurafskys approach, the FrameNet data has not been used extensively.One issue is that the corpus is not a representative sample of the language, but rather consists of sentences chosen manually to illustrate the possible role assignments for a given lexical item.Another issue is that the semantic roles are situation-specic, rather than general roles like Agent, Theme, and Location that can be used across many situations and genres. ::: J08-2001_33:86

E02,M17	However, inmost cases they can only provide a local dependency between predicate and argument for 87% of the argument constituents (Chen and Rambow, 2003), which is too low to provide high SRL accuracy. ::: D07-1062_33:201

F01,F02,F03,F04,F05,F07	Firstly, the 26 constituent-based features used by others are: y The seven "standard" features: predicate (c1), path (c2), phrase type (c3), position (c4), voice (c5), head word (c6) and predicate subcategorization (c7) features proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: C10-2076_58:199
	Another approach used similarity measures either between verbs (Gordon and Swanson, 2007) or between nouns (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) to overcome lexical sparsity. ::: P09-1004_79:272
M02	Regarding the use of tree kernels for SRL, in (Moschitti, 2004) two main drawbacks have been 49 pointed out: Highly accurate boundary detection cannot be carried out by a tree kernel model since correct and incorrect arguments may share a large portion of the encoding trees, i.e. they may share many substructures. ::: W06-2607_19:203
R01	We use the standard training set, consisting of sections 02-21 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank, labeled with PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) annotations for predicates and arguments. ::: P10-1099_49:230
	This, as suggested in (Pradhan et al., 2005; Moschitti, 2004), can help stressing the differ803 ences between different argument types. ::: P08-1091_165:221
	We first used Polynomial Kernels over handcrafted, linguistically-motivated, standard SRL features (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: N09-2022_27:90
*A01,A02,A03,A04,V01,V02,V03	With the advent of supporting resources, SRL has become a well-dened task with a substantial body of work and comparative evaluation (see, among others, Gildea and Jurafsky [2002], Surdeanu et al.[2003], Xue and Palmer [2004], Pradhan et al.[2005a], the CoNLL Shared Task in 2004 and 2005, and Senseval-3 and SemEval-2007).The identication of event frames may potentially benet many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al.2003), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004), summarization (Melli et al.2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002).Related work on classifying the semantic relations in noun phrases has also been encouraging for NLP tasks (Moldovan et al.2004; Rosario and Hearst 2004). ::: J08-2001_16:86
	In (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) seven different features2, which aim to capture the relation between the predicate and its arguments, were proposed. ::: E06-1015_104:212
R01	Automatic Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems, made possible by the availability of PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003; Palmer et al. , 2005), and encouraged by evaluation efforts in (Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Litkowski, 2004), have been shown to accurately determine the argument structure of verb predicates. ::: W06-1617_8:156

F07,M02,R01	The Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005) is an annotated corpus of verb subcategorization and alternations which was created by adding a layer of predicate-argument annotation over the phrase structure trees in the Penn Treebank. ::: W09-2601_38:186
A01,A02,A05	Knowledge of semantic argument structure is essential for language understanding and thus important for applications such as information extraction (Moschitti et al., 2003; Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007), or recognizing textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2009). ::: C10-2107_15:208
R02,V02	Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004). ::: P07-1027_20:194
O02	Furthermore, corpora labelled with semantic role information can be used to train shallow semantic parsers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), which could in turn benefit applications in need of broad-coverage semantic analysis. ::: P06-1146_17:209
P06	In addition, a heuristic based pruning preprocessing (Xue and Palmer, 2004) is used to filter out a lot of apparently inappropriate constituents at the beginning. ::: C10-2076_19:199
F02,M02	In standard SRL systems, these path features usually consist of a sequence of constituent parse nodes representing the shortest path through the parse tree between a word and the predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). ::: P10-1099_104:230
R01,R02	Corpora set-up The above kernels were experimented over two corpora: PropBank (www.cis.upenn.edu/ ace) along with Penn TreeBank5 2 (Marcus et al. , 1993) and FrameNet. ::: P04-1043_144:222
	The effectiveness of the proposed additional pruning techniques may be seen as a significant improvement over the original algorithm of (Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: D09-1004_185:221
	The usual approach (Toutanova et al. , 2005) uses a traditional boundary classifier (TBC) to select the set of potential argument nodes. ::: W06-2909_57:206
	Many of the combinations depart from the manually selected conjunctions of Xue and Palmer (2004). ::: W05-0620_270:334
R01	The semantic roles in the examples are labeled in the style of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), a broad coverage human-annotated corpus of semantic roles and their syntactic realizations. ::: D11-1122_15:233
O02	However, the performance decrease shows that negation scope finding is not as sensitive to automatic syntactic parsing as common shallow semantic parsing, whose performance might decrease by about ~10 in F1-measure (Toutanova et al., 2005). ::: C10-1076_159:201
	As regards i), recently there has been an increase in the number of papers dealing with nominalized predicates (Pradhan et al., 2004) (Jiang and Ng, 2006) (Xue, 2006) (Liu and Ng, 2007). ::: D08-1055_11:129
V01	On the WSJ data, our results surpass with almost 6% the results obtained by the best SRL system that used partial syntax in the CoNLL 2004 shared task evaluation (Hacioglu et al. , 2004). ::: W05-0635_66:78
R01	See (Palmer et al. , 2005) for a detailed discussion of PropBank semantic roles labels. ::: W06-2303_16:147
	In the following decade, great success in terms of parse disambiguation and even language modeling was achieved by various lexicalized PCFG models (Magerman, 1995; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001). ::: P03-1054_8:233
M02	(Chen and Rambow, 2003) use LTAG-based decomposition of parse trees (as is typically done for statistical LTAG parsing) for SRL. ::: D07-1062_178:201
M07	Previous research has shown the benefit of jointly learning semantic roles of multiple constituents (Toutanova et al., 2008; Koomen et al., 2005). ::: D09-1047_25:202
	Note also that the transformations which are taken into account are a superset of the transformations taken into account by Gildea and Palmer (2002). ::: W03-1006_174:259
M02,E01	The 50-best parser is a probabilistic parser that on its own produces high quality parses; the maximum probability parse trees (according to the parsers model) have an f-score of 0.897 on section 23 of the Penn Treebank (Charniak, 2000), which is still state-of-the-art. ::: P05-1022_8:180
R01	The inter-annotator agreement for PropBank reported in (Palmer et al. , 2005) is above 0.9 in terms of the Kappa statistic (Sidney and Castellan Jr. , 1988). ::: W06-1617_138:156
R01,M09	Using the CCGbased parser, Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) find a 2% absolute improvement over the Collins parser in identifying core or numbered PropBank arguments. ::: J05-1004_469:501

M07,M10	The improvement achieved by the joint model relative to the local model is about 2 points absolute in F-Measure, similar to the improvement when gold-standard syntactic parses are used (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: W05-0623_77:79
M02,M09,M17	Other syntactic representations such as CCG derivations (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) and dependency trees (Hacioglu, 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2008) have also been explored. ::: W09-2601_12:186
	Punyakanok et al. , (2004) further showed that constituent-by-constituent (Cby-C) tagging is better than P-by-P. ::: W06-3308_61:196
	In our experiments we employ the features listed in Table 1, defined in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: P08-1091_98:221
	The alternative approach is to combine heuristic and machine-learning approaches (Xue and Palmer, 2004). ::: N06-1055_62:170
	Hacioglu has previously described a chunk based semantic labeling method (Hacioglu et al. , 2004). ::: P05-1072_153:208
M02	In this category, it is also noticeable the use of the syntactic frame feature, proposed by Xue and Palmer (2004). ::: W05-0620_265:334
M02,R01	We present performance results on the February 2004 version of PropBank on gold-standard parse trees as well as results on automatic parses generated by Charniaks parser (Charniak, 2000). ::: P05-1073_15:185
	It is interesting to note that the semantic frames are a helpful way of generalizing between predicates; words in the same frame have been found frequently to share the same syntactic argument structure (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002). ::: J05-1004_276:501
M02	Accordingly, we do not maximize the probability of the entire labeled parse tree as in (Toutanova et al. , 2005). ::: P07-1027_85:194
R01,R02	Detecting and classifying the arguments of predicates has been an active area of research in recent years, driven by the availability of large-scale semantically annotated corpora such as the FrameNet (Baker et al. , 1998) and the Propbank (Palmer et al. , 2005). ::: N06-1055_8:170
	(Gildea and Palmer, 2002) report the results listed on the first line of Table 2. ::: P03-1002_128:187
